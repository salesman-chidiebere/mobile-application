CODE HUNT


Write down the name of any color of your choice (e.g. blue);
Write down the name of any fruit of your choice (e.g. orange);
Join the two words together (e.g. blueorange);
From the two words joined together:
   form 3 new words with 3 letters each (e.g. from blueorange: ran, age, rage)
   form 4 new words with 4 letters each (e.g. from blueorange: rang, ...)
   form 5 new words with 5 letters each (e.g. from blueorange: range, .....)

Pick a word from the 3 letter words, pick another from the 4 letter words, 
and pick the another word from the 5 letter words (e.g. age, rang, range.)

Put each word on a numberline (a=1, b=2, c=3, ..., f=6, ..., i=9...)

Get the sum of the corresponding number value for each word (e.g age = 13)

Repeat the above step for all the words you picked (e.i. age= 13, rang=?, range=?)

Multiply the value of the 3 letter word by 4 letter word and divide the 5 letter word you choose
(e.g. 13x(value of rang)/(value of range))

Write down you final answer.

What you are to submit... (your answer should be like this)
